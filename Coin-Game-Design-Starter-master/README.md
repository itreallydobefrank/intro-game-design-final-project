Fruit Hunter

This is my intro to game design final project. 
The goal of the game is to collect healthy fruit while avoiding enemies and junk food around the map.
This game can be played in both first person and third person
The game ends when the player health bar hits zero or the player collects enough fruit.

A full build of this project can be made by opening it and building it in unity

Controls:
movement is done with the WASD keys
jumping is done with the spacebar
the banana gun is fired by left clicking
sprinting is done by holding shift





I do not own the music used in this game, it belongs to Nintento and I used it strictly for my school project.
